<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This dustbin used to be crammed full by midday, and the floor was normally an inch deep in a compost of trampled food.</p><p>For firing we had nothing but three gas-stoves, without ovens, and all joints had to be sent out to the bakery.</p><p>There was no larder. Our substitute for one was a half-roofed shed in the yard, with a tree growing in the middle of it. The meat, vegetables and so forth lay there on the bare earth, raided by rats and cats.</p><p>There was no hot water laid on. Water for washing up had to be heated in pans, and, as there was no room for these on the stoves when meals were cooking, most of the plates had to be washed in cold water. This, with soft soap and the hard Paris water, meant scraping the grease off with bits of newspaper.</p></div> </div>
