<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After only a week we were all neurasthenic with fatigue, except Jules, who skulked persistently. The quarrels, intermittent at first, had now become continuous. For hours' one would keep up a drizzle of useless nagging, rising into storms of abuse every few minutes. 'Get me down that saucepan, idiot!' the cook would cry (she was not tall enough to reach the shelves where the saucepans were kept). 'Get it down yourself, you old whore,' I would answer. Such remarks seemed to be generated spontaneously from the air of the kitchen.</p><p>We quarrelled over things of inconceivable pettiness. The dustbin, for instance, was an unending source of quarrels--whether it should be put where I wanted it, which was in the cook's way, or where she wanted it, which was between me and the sink.</p></div> </div>
