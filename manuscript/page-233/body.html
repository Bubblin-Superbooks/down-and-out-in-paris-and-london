The terms were, as usual, five hundred francs a month and food, but I had no free day and no fixed working hours. At the Hï¿½tel X I had seen catering at its best, with unlimited money and good organization. Now, at the Auberge, I learned how things are done in a thoroughly bad restaurant. It is worth describing, for there are hundreds of similar restaurants in Paris, and every visitor feeds in one of them occasionally.</p><p>I should add, by the way, that the Auberge was not the ordinary cheap eating-house frequented by students and workmen.</p></div> </div>
