<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Seeing a short, fat man in a bowler hat directing some porters, I went up to him and asked for work. Before answering he seized my right hand and felt the palm.</p><p>'You are strong, eh?' he said.</p><p>'Very strong,' I said untruly.</p><p>'Bien. Let me see you lift that crate.'</p><p>It was a huge wicker basket full of potatoes. I took hold of it, and found that, so far from lifting it, I could not even move it. The man in the bowler hat watched me, then shrugged his shoulders and turned away. I made off. When I had gone some distance I looked back and saw four men lifting the basket on to a cart. It weighed three hundredweight, possibly. The man had seen that I was no use, and taken this way of getting rid of me.</p></div> </div>
