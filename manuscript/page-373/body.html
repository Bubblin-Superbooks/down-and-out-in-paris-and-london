There were Indians there, and when I spoke to one of them in bad Urdu he addressed me as 'turn'--a thing to make one shudder, if it had been in India. We had got below the range of colour prejudice. One had glimpses of curious lives. Old 'Grandpa', a tramp of seventy who made his living, or a great part of it, by collecting cigarette ends and selling the tobacco at threepence an ounce. 'The Doctor'--he was a real doctor, who had been struck off the register for some offence, and besides selling newspapers gave medical advice at a few pence a time.</p></div> </div>
