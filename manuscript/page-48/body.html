<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was the first time that I had been in a French pawnshop. One went through grandiose stone portals (marked, of course, 'Libert�, Egalit�, Fraternit�'--they write that even over the police stations in France) into a large, bare room like a school classroom, with a counter and rows of benches. Forty or fifty people were waiting. One handed one's pledge over the counter and sat down. Presently, when the clerk had assessed its value he would call out, 'Num�ro such and such, will you take fifty francs?' Sometimes it was only fifteen francs, or ten, or five--whatever it was, the whole room knew it. As I Came in the clerk called with an air of offence, 'Num�ro 83--here!' and gave a little whistle and a beckon, as though calling a dog. Num�ro 83 stepped to the counter; he was an old bearded man, with an overcoat buttoned up at the neck and frayed trouser-ends.</p></div> </div>
