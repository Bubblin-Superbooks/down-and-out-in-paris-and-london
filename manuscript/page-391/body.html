'Twopenny' is arrived at like this: head--loaf of bread--twopenny loaf--twopenny]</p><p>The swear words also change--or, at any rate, they are subject to fashions. For example, twenty years ago the London working classes habitually used the word 'bloody'. Now they have abandoned it utterly, though novelists still represent them as using it. No born Londoner (it is different with people of Scotch or Irish origin) now says 'bloody', unless he is a man of some education. The word has, in fact, moved up in the social scale and ceased to be a swear word for the purposes of the working classes. The current London adjective, now tacked on to every noun, is ----. No doubt in time ----, like 'bloody', will find its way into the drawing-room and be replaced by some other word.</p></div> </div>
