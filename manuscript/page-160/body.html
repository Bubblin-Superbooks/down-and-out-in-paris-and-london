<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Four days of the week passed like this; of the other two working days, one was better and one worse. After a week of this life I felt in need of a holiday. It was Saturday night, so the people in our bistro were busy getting drunk, and with a free day ahead of me I was ready to join them. We all went to bed, drunk, at two in the morning, meaning to sleep till noon. At half past five I was suddenly awakened. A night-watchman, sent from the hotel, was standing at my bedside. He stripped the clothes back and shook me roughly.</p><p>'Get up!' he said. 'Tu t'es bien saoulï¿½ la gueule, eh? Well, never mind that, the hotel's a man short. You've got to work today.'</p></div> </div>
