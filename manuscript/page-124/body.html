As we went along, something struck me violently in the back. It was a hundred-pound block of ice, carried by a blue-aproned porter. After him came a boy with a great slab of veal on his shoulder, his cheek pressed into the damp, spongy flesh. They shoved me aside with a cry of 'Sauve-toi, idiot!' and rushed on. On the wall, under one of the lights, someone had written in a very neat hand: 'Sooner will you find a cloudless sky in winter, than a woman at the Hï¿½tel X who has her maidenhead.' It seemed a queer sort of place.</p><p>One of the passages branched off into a laundry, where an old, skull-faced woman gave me a blue apron and a pile of dishcloths.</p></div> </div>
