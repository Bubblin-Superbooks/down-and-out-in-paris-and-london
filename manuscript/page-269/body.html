<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>XXIII</p><p>AS soon as I left the Auberge de Jehan Cottard I went to bed and slept the clock round, all but one hour. Then I washed my teeth for the first time in a fortnight, bathed and had my hair cut, and got my clothes out of pawn. I had two glorious days of loafing. I even went in my best suit to the Auberge, leant against the bar and spent five francs on a bottle of English beer. It is a curious sensation, being a customer where you have been a slave's slave. Boris was sorry that I had left the restaurant just at the moment when we were lanc�s and there was a chance of making money. I have heard from him since, and he tells me that he is making a hundred francs a day and has set up a girl who is tr�s serieuse and never smells of garlic.</p></div> </div>
