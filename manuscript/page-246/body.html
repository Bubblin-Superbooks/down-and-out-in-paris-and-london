<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ONE day, when we had been at the H�tel X five or six weeks, Boris disappeared without notice. In the evening I found him waiting for me in the Rue de Rivoli. He slapped me gaily on the shoulder.</p><p>'Free at last, mon ami! You can give notice in the morning. The Auberge opens tomorrow.'</p><p>'Tomorrow?'</p><p>'Well, possibly we shall need a day or two to arrange things. But, at any rate, no more cafeteria! Nous sommes lanc�s, mon ami! My tail coat is out of pawn already.'</p><p>His manner was so hearty that I felt sure there was something wrong, and I did not at all want to leave my safe and comfortable job at the hotel. However, I had promised Boris, so I gave notice, and the next morning at seven went down to the Auberge de Jehan Cottard.</p></div> </div>
