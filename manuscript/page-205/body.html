Sometimes it was just a confused din of voices; sometimes everyone would burst out together in the same song--the 'Marseillaise', or the 'Internationale', or 'Madelon', or 'Les Fraises et les Framboises'. Azaya, a great clumping peasant girl who worked fourteen hours a day in a glass factory, sang a song about, 'Il a perdu ses pantalons, tout en dansant le Charleston.' Her friend Marinette, a thin, dark Corsican girl of obstinate virtue, tied her knees together and danced the danse du ventre.

R., cadaverous and silent, sat in his comer quietly boozing.</p></div> </div>
