<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You discover that a man who has gone even a week on bread and margarine is not a man any longer, only a belly with a few accessory organs.</p><p>This--one could describe it further, but it is all in the same style --is life on six francs a day. Thousands of people in Paris live it-- struggling artists and students, prostitutes when their luck is out, out-of-work people of all kinds. It is the suburbs, as it were, of poverty.</p><p>I continued in this style for about three weeks. The forty-seven francs were soon gone, and I had to do what I could on thirty-six francs a week from the English lessons. Being inexperienced, I handled the money badly, and sometimes I was a day without food. When this happened I used to sell a few of my clothes, smuggling them out of the hotel in small packets and taking them to a secondhand shop in the rue de la Montagne St Geneviï¿½ve.</p></div> </div>
