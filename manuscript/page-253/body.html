<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For the first few days all our customers were Russians, friends of the patron, and these were followed by Americans and other foreigners--no Frenchmen. Then one night there was tremendous excitement, because our first Frenchman had arrived. For a moment our quarrels were forgotten and we all united in the effort to serve a good dinner. Boris tiptoed into the kitchen, jerked his thumb over his shoulder and whispered conspiratorially:</p><p>'Sh! Attention, un Fran�ais!'</p><p>A moment later the patron's wife came and whispered:</p><p>'Attention, un Fran�ais! See that he gets a double portion of all vegetables.'</p><p>While the Frenchman ate, the patron's wife stood behind the grille of the kitchen door and watched the expression of his face. Next night the Frenchman came back with two other Frenchmen. This meant that we were earning a good name; the surest sign of a bad restaurant is to be frequented only by foreigners.</p></div> </div>
