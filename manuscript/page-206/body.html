<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'"�coute, mon cher," I said to myself, "you'll be starving to death if this goes on much longer. You've got to do something. Why not try a prayer to Sainte �loise? Go down on your knees and ask her to send you some money. After all, it can't do any harm. Try it!"</p><p>'Mad, eh? Still, a man will do anything when he's hungry. Besides, as I said, it couldn't do any harm. I got out of bed and began praying. I said:</p><p>'"Dear Sainte �loise, if you exist, please send me some money. I don't ask for much--just enough to buy some bread and a bottle of wine and get my strength back. Three or four francs would do. You don't know how grateful I'll be, Sainte �loise, if you help me this once.</p></div> </div>
