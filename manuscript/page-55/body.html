<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'Ah, mais, mon ami, the ups and downs of life! A captain in the Russian Army, and then, piff! the Revolution--every penny gone. In 1916 I stayed a week at the H�tel �douard Sept; in 1920 I was trying for a job as night watchman there. I have been night watchman, cellarman, floor scrubber, dishwasher, porter, lavatory attendant. I have tipped waiters, and I have been tipped by waiters.</p><p>'Ah, but I have known what it is to live like a gentleman, mon ami. I do not say it to boast, but the other day I was trying to compute how many mistresses I have had in my life, and I made it out to be over two hundred. Yes, at least two hundred... Ah, well, �a reviendra. Victory is to him who fights the longest. Courage!' etc. etc.</p></div> </div>
