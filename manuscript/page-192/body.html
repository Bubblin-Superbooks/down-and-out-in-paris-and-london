<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mario, who was in charge of the cafeterie, had the typical drudge mentality. All he thought of was getting through the 'boulot', and he defied you to give him too much of it. Fourteen years underground had left him with about as much natural laziness as a piston rod. 'Faut ï¿½tre dur,' he used to say when anyone complained. You will often hear plongeurs boast, 'Je suis dur'--as though they were soldiers, not male charwomen.</p><p>Thus everyone in the hotel had his sense of honour, and when the press of work came we were all ready for a grand concerted effort to get through it. The constant war between the different departments also made for efficiency, for everyone clung to his own privileges and tried to stop the others idling and pilfering.</p></div> </div>
