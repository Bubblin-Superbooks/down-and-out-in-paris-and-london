Why can't you throw them out of the window like everyone else? Putain! Salope!'</p><p>THE WOMAN ON THE THIRD FLOOR: 'Vache!'</p><p>Thereupon a whole variegated chorus of yells, as windows were flung open on every side and half the street joined in the quarrel. They shut up abruptly ten minutes later, when a squadron of cavalry rode past and people stopped shouting to look at them.</p><p>I sketch this scene, just to convey something of the spirit of the rue du Coq d'Or. Not that quarrels were the only thing that happened there-- but still, we seldom got through the morning without at least one outburst of this description.</p></div> </div>
