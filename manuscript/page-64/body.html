I explained that I had only about sixty francs left and must get a job immediately. By this time, however, Boris had eaten the rest of the bread and was feeling cheerful and talkative. He said carelessly:</p><p>'Good heavens, what are you worrying about? Sixty francs--why, it's a fortune! Please hand me that shoe, mon ami. I'm going to smash some of those bugs if they come within reach.'</p><p>'But do you think there's any chance of getting a job?'</p><p>'Chance? It's a certainty. In fact, I have got something already. There is a new Russian restaurant which is to open in a few days in the rue du Commerce. It is une chose entendue that I am to be ma�tre d'h�tel. I can easily get you a job in the kitchen. Five hundred francs a month and your food--tips, too, if you are lucky.'</p></div> </div>
