<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Tea ended, and I saw the tramps looking furtively at one another. An unspoken thought was running from man to man--could we possibly make off before the prayers started? Someone stirred in his chair--not getting up actually, but with just a glance at the door, as though half suggesting the idea of departure. The lady quelled him with one look. She said in a more benign tone than ever:</p><p>'I don't think you need go quite yet. The casual ward doesn't open till six, and we have time to kneel down and say a few words to our Father first. I think we should all feel better after that, shouldn't we?'</p><p>The red-nosed man was very helpful, pulling the harmonium into place and handing out the prayerbooks.</p></div> </div>
