<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was, indeed, a sufficiently ludicrous service--the kind where there are sudden yells of 'Hallelujah!' and endless extempore prayers--but their behaviour passed all bounds. There was one old fellow in the congregation --Brother Bootle or some such name--who was often called on to lead us in prayer, and whenever he stood up the tramps would begin stamping as though in a theatre; they said that on a previous occasion he had kept up an extempore prayer for twenty-five minutes, until the minister had interrupted him. Once when Brother Bootle stood up a tramp called out, 'Two to one 'e don't beat seven minutes!' so loud that the whole church must hear. It was not long before we were making far more noise than the minister. Sometimes somebody below would send up an indignant 'Hush!' but it made no impression. We had set ourselves to guy the service, and there was no stopping us.</p></div> </div>
