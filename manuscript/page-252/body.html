He used to walk up and down shaking his fist, and trying to incite me not to work:</p><p>'Put that brush down, you fool! You and I belong to proud races; we don't work for nothing, like these damned Russian serfs. I tell you, to be cheated like this is torture to me. There have been times in my life, when someone has cheated me even of five sous, when I have vomited--yes, vomited with rage.</p><p>'Besides, mon vieux, don't forget that I'm a Communist. ï¿½ bas la bourgeoisie! Did any man alive ever see me working when I could avoid it? No. And not only I don't wear myself out working, like you other fools, but I steal, just to show my independence.</p></div> </div>
