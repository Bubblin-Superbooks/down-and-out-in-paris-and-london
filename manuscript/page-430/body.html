<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I WANT to put in some notes, as short as possible, on London slang and swearing. These (omitting the ones that everyone knows) are some of the cant words now used in London:</p><p>A gagger--beggar or street performer of any kind. A moocher--one who begs outright, without pretence of doing a trade. A nobbier--one who collects pennies for a beggar. A chanter--a street singer. A clodhopper --a street dancer. A mugfaker--a street photographer. A glimmer--one who watches vacant motor-cars. A gee (or jee--it is pronounced jee)-- the accomplice of a cheapjack, who stimulates trade by pretending to buy something. A split--a detective. A flattie--a policeman. A dideki--a gypsy. A toby--a tramp.</p></div> </div>
