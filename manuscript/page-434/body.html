Perhaps all the words I have mentioned above will have vanished in another twenty years.</p><p>[* It survives in certain abbreviations, such as 'use your twopenny' or 'use your head.' 'Twopenny' is arrived at like this: head--loaf of bread--twopenny loaf--twopenny]</p><p>The swear words also change--or, at any rate, they are subject to fashions. For example, twenty years ago the London working classes habitually used the word 'bloody'. Now they have abandoned it utterly, though novelists still represent them as using it. No born Londoner (it is different with people of Scotch or Irish origin) now says 'bloody', unless he is a man of some education.</p></div> </div>
