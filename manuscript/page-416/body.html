<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The last night I was twopence short of my kip, so I goes up to a parson and mooches 'im for threepence. He give me threepence, and the next moment he turns round and gives me in charge for beggin'. "You bin beggin'," the copper says. "No I ain't," I says, "I was askin' the gentleman the time," I says. The copper starts feelin' inside my coat, and he pulls out a pound of meat and two loaves of bread. "Well, what's all this, then?" he says. "You better come 'long to the station," he says. The beak give me seven days. I don't mooch from no more--parsons. But Christ! what do I care for a lay-up of seven days?' etc. etc.</p><p>It seemed that his whole life was this--a round of mooching, drunks, and lay-ups. He laughed as he talked of it, taking it all for a tremendous joke.</p></div> </div>
