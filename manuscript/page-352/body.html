There was a horrible hot reek of urine, so beastly that at first one tried to breathe in small, shallow puffs, not filling one's lungs to the bottom. As I lay down in bed a man loomed out of the darkness, leant over me and began babbling in an educated, half-drunken voice:</p><p>'An old public schoolboy, what? [He had heard me say something to Paddy.] Don't meet many of the old school here. I am an old Etonian. You know--twenty years hence this weather and all that.' He began to quaver out the Eton boating-song, not untunefully:</p><p>'Stop that--noise!' shouted several lodgers.</p></div> </div>
