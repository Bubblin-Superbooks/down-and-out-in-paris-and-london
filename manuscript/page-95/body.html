I realized that I must do something at once, and I decided to go and ask Boris to let me share his two francs, at any rate for a day or two. When I arrived I found Boris in bed, and furiously angry. As soon as I came in he burst out, almost choking:</p><p>'He has taken it back, the dirty thief! He has taken it back!'</p><p>'Who's taken what?' I said.</p><p>'The Jew! Taken my two francs, the dog, the thief! He robbed me in my sleep!'</p><p>It appeared that on the previous night the Jew had flatly refused to pay the daily two francs. They had argued and argued, and at last the Jew had consented to hand over the money; he had done it, Boris said, in the most offensive manner, making a little speech about how kind he was, and extorting abject gratitude. And then in the morning he had stolen the money back before Boris was awake.</p></div> </div>
