<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When you went into the ice cupboard you dropped a hundred degrees of temperature at a single step; it used to remind me of the hymn about Greenland's icy mountains and India's coral strand. Two men worked in the cafeterie besides Boris and myself. One was Mario, a huge, excitable Italian--he was like a city policeman with operatic gestures-- and the other, a hairy, uncouth animal whom we called the Magyar; I think he was a Transylvanian, or something even more remote. Except the Magyar we were all big men, and at the rush hours we collided incessantly.</p><p>The work in the cafeterie was spasmodic. We were never idle, but the real work only came in bursts of two hours at a time--we called each burst 'un coup de feu'. The first coup de feu came at eight, when the guests upstairs began to wake up and demand breakfast.</p></div> </div>
