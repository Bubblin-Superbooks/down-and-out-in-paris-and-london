<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When one has realized that, one begins to put oneself in a tramp's place and understand what his life is like. It is an extraordinarily futile, acutely unpleasant life. I have described the casual ward--the routine of a tramp's day--but there are three especial evils that need insisting upon. The first is hunger, which is the almost general fate of tramps. The casual ward gives them a ration which is probably not even meant to be sufficient, and anything beyond this must be got by begging--that is, by breaking the law. The result is that nearly every tramp is rotted by malnutrition; for proof of which one need only look at the men lining up outside any casual ward. The second great evil of a tramp's life--it seems much smaller at first sight, but it is a good second--is that he is entirely cut off from contact with women. This point needs elaborating.</p></div> </div>
