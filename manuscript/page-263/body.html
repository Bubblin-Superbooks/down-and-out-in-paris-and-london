<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Suppose it is granted that a plongeur's work is more or less useless. Then the question follows, Why does anyone want him to go on working? I am trying to go beyond the immediate economic cause, and to consider what pleasure it can give anyone to think of men swabbing dishes for life. For there is no doubt that people--comfortably situated people--do find a pleasure in such thoughts. A slave, Marcus Cato said, should be working when he is not sleeping. It does not matter whether his work is needed or not, he must work, because work in itself is good--for slaves, at least. This sentiment still survives, and it has piled up mountains of useless drudgery.</p><p>I believe that this instinct to perpetuate useless work is, at bottom, simply fear of the mob.</p></div> </div>
