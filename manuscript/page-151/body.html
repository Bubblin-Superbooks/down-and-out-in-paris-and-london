<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One was Mario, a huge, excitable Italian--he was like a city policeman with operatic gestures-- and the other, a hairy, uncouth animal whom we called the Magyar; I think he was a Transylvanian, or something even more remote. Except the Magyar we were all big men, and at the rush hours we collided incessantly.</p><p>The work in the cafeterie was spasmodic. We were never idle, but the real work only came in bursts of two hours at a time--we called each burst 'un coup de feu'. The first coup de feu came at eight, when the guests upstairs began to wake up and demand breakfast. At eight a sudden banging and yelling would break out all through the basement; bells rang on all sides, blue-aproned men rushed through the passages, our service lifts came down with a simultaneous crash, and the waiters on all five floors began shouting Italian oaths down the shafts.</p></div> </div>
