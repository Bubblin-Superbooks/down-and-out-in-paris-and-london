<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'Mad, eh? Still, a man will do anything when he's hungry. Besides, as I said, it couldn't do any harm. I got out of bed and began praying. I said:</p><p>'"Dear Sainte �loise, if you exist, please send me some money. I don't ask for much--just enough to buy some bread and a bottle of wine and get my strength back. Three or four francs would do. You don't know how grateful I'll be, Sainte �loise, if you help me this once. And be sure, if you send me anything, the first thing I'll do will be to go and bum a candle for you, at your church down the street. Amen."</p></div> </div>
