<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>LIFE in the quarter. Our bistro, for instance, at the foot of the H�tel des Trois Moineaux. A tiny brick-floored room, half underground, with wine-sodden tables, and a photograph of a funeral inscribed 'Cr�dit est mort'; and red-sashed workmen carving sausage with big jack-knives; and Madame F., a splendid Auvergnat peasant woman with the face of a strong-minded cow, drinking Malaga all day 'for her stomach'; and games of dice for ap�ritifs; and songs about 'Les Fraises et Les Framboises', and about Madelon, who said, 'Comment �pouser un soldat, moi qui aime tout le r�giment?'; and extraordinarily public love-making. Half the hotel used to meet in the bistro in the evenings. I wish one could find a pub in London a quarter as cheery.</p></div> </div>
