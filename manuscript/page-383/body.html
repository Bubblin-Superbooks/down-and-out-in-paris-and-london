One or two officers in uniform prowled up and down. On the wall were pictures of General Booth, and notices prohibiting cooking, drinking, spitting, swearing, quarrelling, and gambling. As a specimen of these notices, here is one that I copied word for word:</p><p>Any man found gambling or playing cards will be expelled and will not be admitted under any circumstances.</p><p>A reward will be given for information leading to the discovery of such persons.</p><p>The officers in charge appeal to all lodgers to assist them in keeping this hostel free from the DETESTABLE EVIL OF GAMBLING.</p></div> </div>
