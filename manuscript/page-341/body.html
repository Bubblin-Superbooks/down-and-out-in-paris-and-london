It is curious how one does not notice things. I had been in London innumerable times, and yet till that day I had never noticed one of the worst things about London--the fact that it costs money even to sit down. In Paris, if you had no money and could not find a public bench, you would sit on the pavement. Heaven knows what sitting on the pavement would lead to in London--prison, probably. By four we had stood five hours, and our feet seemed red-hot from the hardness of the stones.</p></div> </div>
