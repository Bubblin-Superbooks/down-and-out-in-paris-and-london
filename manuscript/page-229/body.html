<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Everyone was very happy, overwhelmingly certain that the world was a good place and we a notable set of people.</p><p>For an hour the noise scarcely slackened. Then about midnight there was a piercing shout of 'Citoyens!' and the sound of a chair falling over. A blond, red-faced workman had risen to his feet and was banging a bottle on the table. Everyone stopped singing; the word went round, 'Sh! Furex is starting!' Furex was a strange creature, a Limousin stonemason who worked steadily all the week and drank himself into a kind of paroxysm on Saturdays. He had lost his memory and could not remember anything before the war, and he would have gone to pieces through drink if Madame F. had not taken care of him. On Saturday evenings at about five o'clock she would say to someone, 'Catch Furex before he spends his wages,' and when he had been caught she would take away his money, leaving him enough for one good drink.</p></div> </div>
