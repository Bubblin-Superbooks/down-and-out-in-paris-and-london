<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One of them was blind, and I heard them say that they had been saving up for a long time to buy a board, price half a crown, but could never manage it. Here and there were clerks out of work, pallid and moody. Among a group of them a tall, thin, deadly pale young man was talking excitedly. He thumped his fist on the table and boasted in a strange, feverish style. When the officers were out of hearing he broke out into startling blasphemies:</p><p>'I tell you what, boys, I'm going to get that job tomorrow. I'm not one of your bloody down-on-the-knee brigade; I can look after myself. Look at that--notice there! "The Lord will provide!" A bloody lot He's ever provided me with. You don't catch me trusting to the--Lord. You leave it to me, boys. I'm going to get that job,' etc. etc.</p></div> </div>
