<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Below screevers come the people who sing hymns, or sell matches, or bootlaces, or envelopes containing a few grains of lavender--called, euphemistically, perfume. All these people are frankly beggars, exploiting an appearance of misery, and none of them takes on an average more than half a crown a day. The reason why they have to pretend to sell matches and so forth instead of begging outright is that this is demanded by the absurd English laws about begging. As the law now stands, if you approach a stranger and ask him for twopence, he can call a policeman and get you seven days for begging. But if you make the air hideous by droning 'Nearer, my God, to Thee,' or scrawl some chalk daubs on the pavement, or stand about with a tray of matches--in short, if you make a nuisance of yourself--you are held to be following a legitimate trade and not begging. Match-selling and street-singing are simply legalized crimes.</p></div> </div>
