<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Figure it to yourselves, messieurs et dames! Red carpet on the floor, red paper on the walls, red plush on the chairs, even the ceiling red; everywhere red, burning into the eyes. It was a heavy, stifling red, as though the light were shining through bowls of blood. At the far end stood a huge, square bed, with quilts red like the rest, and on it a girl was lying, dressed in a frock of red velvet. At the sight of me she shrank away and tried to hide her knees under the short dress.</p><p>'I had halted by the door. "Come here, my chicken," I called to her.</p><p>'She gave a whimper of fright. With a bound I was beside the bed; she tried to elude me, but I seized her by the throat--like this, do you see? --tight!</p></div> </div>
