<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Clods--coppers. A drum--a billy can. Shackles--soup. A chat--a louse. Hard-up--tobacco made from cigarette ends. A stick or cane--a burglar's jemmy. A peter--a safe. A bly--a burglar's oxy-acetylene blow-lamp.</p><p>To bawl--to suck or swallow. To knock off--to steal. To skipper--to sleep in the open.</p><p>About half of these words are in the larger dictionaries. It is interesting to guess at the derivation of some of them, though one or two --for instance, 'funkum' and 'tosheroon'--are beyond guessing. 'Deaner' presumably comes from 'denier'. 'Glimmer' (with the verb 'to glim') may have something to do with the old word 'glim', meaning a light, or another old word 'glim', meaning a glimpse; but it is an instance of the formation of new words, for in its present sense it can hardly be older than motor-cars.</p></div> </div>
