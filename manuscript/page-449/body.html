The casual ward gives them a ration which is probably not even meant to be sufficient, and anything beyond this must be got by begging--that is, by breaking the law. The result is that nearly every tramp is rotted by malnutrition; for proof of which one need only look at the men lining up outside any casual ward. The second great evil of a tramp's life--it seems much smaller at first sight, but it is a good second--is that he is entirely cut off from contact with women. This point needs elaborating.</p><p>Tramps are cut off from women, in the first place, because there are very few women at their level of society. One might imagine that among destitute people the sexes would be as equally balanced as elsewhere.</p></div> </div>
