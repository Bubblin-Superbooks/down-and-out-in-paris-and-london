And instantly, as though at a signal, the tramps began to misbehave in the most outrageous way. One would not have thought such scenes possible in a church. All round the gallery men lolled in their pews, laughed, chattered, leaned over and flicked pellets of bread among the congregation; I had to restrain the man next to me, more or less by force, from lighting a cigarette. The tramps treated the service as a purely comic spectacle. It was, indeed, a sufficiently ludicrous service--the kind where there are sudden yells of 'Hallelujah!' and endless extempore prayers--but their behaviour passed all bounds. There was one old fellow in the congregation --Brother Bootle or some such name--who was often called on to lead us in prayer, and whenever he stood up the tramps would begin stamping as though in a theatre;</p></div> </div>
