<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'Which of you is Blank?' (I forget what name I had given.)</p><p>'Me, sir.'</p><p>'So you are a journalist?'</p><p>'Yes, sir,' I said, quaking. A few questions would betray the fact that I had been lying, which might mean prison. But the Tramp Major only looked me up and down and said:</p><p>'Then you are a gentleman?'</p><p>'I suppose so.'</p><p>He gave me another long look. 'Well, that's bloody bad luck, guv'nor,' he said; 'bloody bad luck that is.' And thereafter he treated me with unfair favouritism, and even with a kind of deference. He did not search me, and in the bathroom he actually gave me a clean towel to myself--an unheard-of luxury. So powerful is the word 'gentleman' in an old soldier's ear.</p></div> </div>
